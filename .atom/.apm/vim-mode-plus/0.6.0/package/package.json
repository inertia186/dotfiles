You can't use both simultaneously.\n- Following packages for vim-mode won't work in vim-mode-plus. Why? Because service API name is different. It's easy to add support I believe. Please report to each project.\n  - [vim-mode-clipboard-plus](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-clipboard-plus)\n  - [ex-mode](https://atom.io/packages/ex-mode)\n  - [vim-surround](https://atom.io/packages/vim-surround): surround feature included vim-mode-plus, so you won't need this.\n  - [vim-mode-visual-block](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-visual-block): (my package) builtin to vim-mode-plus with better integration.\n- Scope for CSS selector and keymap is different from vim-mode, **not compatible**.\n- Internal code base is very different. Thus, issue, PRs should be directly sent to vim-mode-plus. **DONT** report vim-mode-plus's issue or PRs to official vim-mode.\n\n# GIFs\n\n## Incremental search\n\nYou can move between match with <kbd>tab</kbd> and <kbd>shift-tab</kdb>.\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/59ce4757d9d11c8d913efc972b58c18345fdbf06/img/vim-mode-plus/incremental-search.gif)\n\n## Surround builtin\n\nOff course, you can repeat with `.`.\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/59ce4757d9d11c8d913efc972b58c18345fdbf06/img/vim-mode-plus/surround.gif)\n\n## Visual block mode builtin.\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/59ce4757d9d11c8d913efc972b58c18345fdbf06/img/vim-mode-plus/visual-blockwise-cursor.gif)\n\n## AnyPair TextObject\n\nAuto detect inner and a Pair, and expandable.\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/46f808a31fb62f6d122062b969c03a2cb9196d23/img/vim-mode-plus/text-object-any-pair.gif)\n\n## Flash on operate\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/59ce4757d9d11c8d913efc972b58c18345fdbf06/img/vim-mode-plus/flashing-range.gif)\n\n##  Hover icon\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/59ce4757d9d11c8d913efc972b58c18345fdbf06/img/vim-mode-plus/hover-icon.gif)\n\n## Hover emoji\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/59ce4757d9d11c8d913efc972b58c18345fdbf06/img/vim-mode-plus/hover-emoji.gif)\n\n## ChangeSurroundAnyPair Operator\n\nAuto detect pair, and pre-select target range and show pair char which will be changed on hover.\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/59ce4757d9d11c8d913efc972b58c18345fdbf06/img/vim-mode-plus/preselect-changed-surround.gif)\n\n## Flash matched word on SearchCurrentWord\n\nWhen search with `#`, `*`, show 'current/total' match on hover, and flash word under cursor.\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/59ce4757d9d11c8d913efc972b58c18345fdbf06/img/vim-mode-plus/search-flash-and-counter.gif)\n\n## Submode shift in Visual mode.\n\nWith showing cursor appropriately in charcterwise and blockwise mode(still cursor hidden in linewise).\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/59ce4757d9d11c8d913efc972b58c18345fdbf06/img/vim-mode-plus/visualmode-submod-shift.gif)\n\n## increase/decrease number in visual-mode.\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/3c672ff1ec9c2ee6ad0567bcbbff5e3095dda9b8/img/vim-mode-plus/increase-in-visual-mode.gif)\n\n## `gv` to re-select previous visual area.\n\n![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t9md/t9md/416d2692fc3bfec284824bc269458747242c6d53/img/vim-mode-plus/activate-previous-visual-mode.gif)\n\n# FAQ\n\n### Why fork? why not directly contribute to official vim-mode.\n\n- Changes are too big.\n- Some features are too experimental to merge official vim-mode.\n\n# New Features\n\n- Operator\n  - [Surround][Surround]:\n    - Surround, DeleteSurround, ChangeSurround. It's repeatable with `.`.\n    - SurroundWord pre-targeted to inner-word.\n    - DeleteSurroundAnyPair: Delete surrounding pair of AnyPair TextObject. Auto-find surround char to delete.\n    - ChangeSurroundAnyPair: Change surrounding pair of AnyPair TextObject. Auto-find surround char to change.\n  - Common string transformation: [SnakeCase][SnakeCase], [CamelCase][CamelCase], [DashCase][DashCase].\n  - ToggleLineComments: Toggle comment for lines.\n  - ReplaceWithRegister: Replace with content of specified register.\n  - All target-requiring operator behave as linewise alias when repeated, e.g. `gugu`, `guu` `gUgU`, `gUU` and others.\n  - Options to keep cursor position in string transformation. e.g. Not move cursor in `gUU`, surround etc.\n- TextObject\n  - Indentation: Select consecutive lines with deeper indent level than current line's indent level.\n  - Entire: Entire buffer.\n  - CurrentLine: Useful when you do surround line.\n  - Fold:\n  - Comment: Consecutive commented lines.\n  - AnyPair. it select nearest pair(surround) from one of following pair.\n    - `'\"\"', \"''\", \"``\", \"{}\", \"<>\", \"><\", \"[]\", \"()\"`.\n  - AnyQuote. it select nearest pair(surround) from one of following pair.\n    - `'\"\"', \"''\", \"``\"`. Difference from AnyPair is it work within line and can select forwarding range out of cursor.\n  - Function: Select inner-function(body) or a-function.\n  - Pair family skip backslash escaped pair character.\n- Instant UI feedback\n  - Showing icon/emoji which represent current operation e.g. show :camel: in CamelCase operation.\n  - Show active counter on hover indicator like `10` when you do `10yy`.\n  - Show active register on hover indicator like `\"a` when you do `\"ayy`\n  - Flashing(highlighting) operation affected area(range) for yank, paste, toggle etc..\n  - Flashing found entry on Search and SearchCurrentWord.\n  - Show current/total hover counter on Search and SearchCurrentWord.\n- Incremental search.\n  - Auto scroll next matching entry as you type.\n  - `search-visit-next` and `vim-mode-plus:search-visit-prev` allow you quickly visit match. Mapped to `tab` and `shift-tab`.\n  - `ctrl-v` on search editor start literal input mode, next single char you input is skip keybinding on search editor(useful when you keymap normal key like `;` to `confirm()`).\n  - [Experimental] Disable default RegExp search by using space starting seach word 1st space removed on search.\n  - [Experimental] Scroll next/prev \"page\" of matching entry, \"page\" is not actual page, so scroll only match found area, useful to quick skim for match out of screen.  \n  - `search-insert-wild-pattern` insert `.*?` pattern to search area you can keymap this command as shortcut for semi-fuzzy search.\n- VisualMode improve\n  - Show cursor in visual-mode except linewise submode.\n  - Visual block mode except yank and paste.\n  - Columns are correctly remembered and restored when shift between submode: char-to-block, block-to-line, line-to-char etc.\n- Other\n  - Not expand folds when selection go across folded row. `l`, `h` expand fold.\n  - Expose visual-mode's submode to text-editor-element's css class to be used as selector.\n  - [Disabled temporarily] Show cursor(by using decoration) while waiting user input (e.g `m`, `\"`).\n  - Developer friendly introspection report and real-time opration-stack monitoring(logged on console).\n  - Spec is more easy to read by using mini DSL provided by spec helper.\n  - Lots of minor bug fix which is not fixed in official vim-mode.\n\n[Surround]:https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/master/docs/TOM-report.md#surround--transformstring\n[SnakeCase]:https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/master/docs/TOM-report.md#snakecase--transformstring\n[CamelCase]:https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/master/docs/TOM-report.md#camelcase--transformstring\n[DashCase]:https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/master/docs/TOM-report.md#dashcase--transformstring\n\n# TOM-report\n\n- [TOM-report](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/master/docs/TOM-report.md)\n\nDone by extending Base class, so each TOM and its instance can report itself.\nTOM: TextObject, Operator, Motion\n\n# Configuration\n\n# Disable autocomplete-plus's auto suggestion in replace mode\n\nTo disable auto suggestion for vim-mode-plus, set following value on autocomplete-plus setting.\n\n### suppressActivationForEditorClasses\n\n```\nvim-mode-plus.normal-mode, vim-mode-plus.visual-mode, vim-mode-plus.operator-pending-mode, vim-mode-plus.insert-mode.replace\n```\n\nIf you want to directly edit `config.cson`, here is how it looks like.\n\n```coffeescript\n\"autocomplete-plus\":\n  suppressActivationForEditorClasses: [\n    \"vim-mode-plus.normal-mode\"\n    \"vim-mode-plus.visual-mode\"\n    \"vim-mode-plus.operator-pending-mode\"\n    \"vim-mode-plus.insert-mode.replace\"\n  ]\n```\n\n## Keymap\n\nSome of the keymap is not set by default, consult [TOM-report](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/master/docs/TOM-report.md), [keymaps](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/master/keymaps/vim-mode-plus.cson) for detail.  \n\nHere is my keymap as an example including keymaps for helper packages.\n\n```coffeescript\n# Workspace\n# -------------------------\n# [other package] need to install cursor-history and paner\n'atom-workspace:not([mini])':\n  'ctrl-i': 'cursor-history:next'\n  'ctrl-o': 'cursor-history:prev'\n  'ctrl-cmd-i': 'cursor-history:next-within-editor'\n  'ctrl-cmd-o': 'cursor-history:prev-within-editor'\n  #
